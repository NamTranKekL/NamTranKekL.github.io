I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/), and expect to graduate in Early of 2025.

My primary focus is on decision-making problems under uncertainty with rich (geometric and combinatorial) structures. I am also working on developing incentive schemes to encourage collaboration among learning agents.

During my PhD, I have been conducting research under the supervision of [Prof. Long Tran-Thanh](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/long_tran-thanh/).

## Research Interest
My primary research interest is statistical perspective of interactive decision making, especial bandit and reinforcement learning problems. In practice, learning agents often operate in environments with rich physical and combinatorial structures, which are reflected in  geometric and combinatorial patterns in the collected data.
Particularly, I am interested in how these structures (either given or hidden), especially symmetries, of decision-making problems can be exploited to design faster learning algorithms.
I also started looking at how learning agents can use these structures to act against data corruption.

My second interest is in designing incentive schemes to encourage cooperative behavior among strategic agents. Specifically, I focus on online credit assignment and contract design, where geometric and combinatorial structures such as convexity and submodularity can be leveraged to design efficient algorithms.

## News

October 2025: I was fortunate to visit [Nicol√≤ Cesa-Bianchi's](https://cesa-bianchi.di.unimi.it/) research group and present our paper on [Symmetric Linear Bandit with Hidden Symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13899). It was a delightful experience to discuss with one of the most brilliant minds in the field of online learning.

**I expect to graduate in early 2025, and I am actively searching for research opportunities in both academia and industry. If you have any suggestions, advice, or questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Many thanks!**

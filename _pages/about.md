I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/), and expect to graduate in Early of 2025.

My primary focus is on decision-making problems under uncertainty with rich (geometric and combinatorial) structures. I am also working on developing incentive schemes to encourage collaboration among learning agents.

During my PhD, I have been conducting research under the supervision of [Prof. Long Tran-Thanh](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/long_tran-thanh/).
